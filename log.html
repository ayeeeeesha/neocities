<p>Ahh my first semester ended. I am so happy. It may be 4 years, but tomorrow my winter vacations are starting. um and now i have vacations of five weeks</p>

<p class="date">7 8 9.10.2025</p>
<p>Finals preparation. I think the more I prepare, the worse the paper goes, and the less I prepare, the better it goes. Haha, it's psychology!</p>

<p class="date">5 6.10.2025</p>
<p>I rested and didn't take any headache.</p>

<p class="date">2 3 4.10.2025</p>
<p>I am happy this semester is ending. I think I will get a good GPA in my first semester. I miss my previous December more than now. I also think the world is like Minecraft: all objects are square and rectangle, and the mirror world is real. Haha, just a thought. My finals are coming, so I have to work hard. There's a saying: you only get one chance to prove it.</p>

<p class="date">1.10.2025</p>
<p>Made my first-ever website and got full marks.</p>

<p class="date">30.09.2025</p>
<p>It's weekend, and I had fun. I started Maxton Hall, and it's an emotional rollercoaster.</p>

<p class="date">28.09.2025</p>
<p>Watched "Dream Come True." It was so emotional. The girl wanted her family to be happy. I saw myself in her and cried.</p>

<p class="date">27.09.2025</p>
<p>Watched a live play in the university event. Also cried today.</p>

<p class="date">23.09.2025</p>
<p>I wasted my weekends making a website. Now only 2 weeks left for my finals, and I haven't prepared yet.</p>

<p class="date">21.10.2025</p>
<p>We sneaked into a hidden place in university. It was a beautiful room.</p>

<p class="date">20.10.2025</p>
<p>Made friends in uni.</p>

<p class="date">16.10.2025</p>
<p>I watched "Our Fault" and couldn’t stop smiling after such a long time. It was so pretty and lovely.</p>

<p class="date">14.10.2025</p>
<p>I watched "Interstellar," and it changed my view of physics. I want to learn more about physics, space, and black holes. Physics and math feel like magic that created this beautiful world.</p>

<p class="date">18.08.2025</p>
<p>My first year of uni.</p>
